## Prerequisites

* Google chrome browser
* Python

## Setup

This project will also require having pipenv to set up a virtual environment and install dependencies. Install pipenv (if have, skip the following commands):
```
## Windows:
  $ pip install pipenv

## MacOS
  $ brew install pipenv
```

Clone the repository and cd into the project's saved directory path. 
Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies by running the following shell commands (recommended):

```
  $ pipenv shell 
  $ pipenv sync
```

Alternatively, a requirements.txt file is provided in the project directory for installing needed dependencies:
```
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following commands 

```
## Windows:
  `$ python src/main.py`

## MacOS:
  `$ PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/main.py`

```

Wait for the program to run. The Google Chrome browser will open through Selenium Webdriver, then print the solution in the command line when complete.

Troubleshooting: In the event script is missing modules, set the PYTHONPATH to the project's directory. Provided below set the python path to the cloned project directory:

```
## Powershell: 
  $ $Env:PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"

## Shell:
  $ export PYTHONPATH="C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"

## Windows:
  $ setx PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"
```

When finished, simply type the following shell command in project directory to close the virtual environment:

```
  `$ exit`
```

## Usage
This project is for the demonstration and application of python and selenium program to interface with a webpage.
See the Pipfile for cumulative list of dependencies primarily needed for the scripts to run.
