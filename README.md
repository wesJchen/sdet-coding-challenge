# SDET-Coding-Challenge
A coding project based on webscraping and testing on http://sdetchallenge.fetch.com/

Objective: Using a balance scale and a set of gold coins, identify the counterfeit gold coin among them. All genuine coins have identical weight, while the fraudulent one is lighter than the authentic ones.

## Prerequisites

In order for the solution script to find the fake gold, the following must be installed onto your machine:

* Google chrome browser
* Python

## Setup

This project will also require having pipenv to set up the virtual environment and install dependencies. Install pipenv (if already have, skip this step):
```
## Windows:
  $ pip install pipenv

## MacOS
  $ brew install pipenv
```

Clone the repository and cd into the project's saved directory path. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies by running the following shell commands (recommended):

```
  $ pipenv shell 
  $ pipenv sync
```

Alternatively, a requirements.txt file is provided in the project directory for installing needed dependencies:
```
  $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now, run the following commands in the command line to execute script and process the solution: 

```
## Windows:
  `$ python src/main.py`

## MacOS:
  `$ PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/main.py`
```

Wait for the program to run. The Google Chrome browser will open through Selenium Webdriver, then print the solution in the command line when complete. When finished with the program, simply type the following shell command in project directory to close the virtual environment:

```
  `$ exit`
```

## Troubleshooting:
In the event script is missing modules, set the PYTHONPATH to the project's directory. Provided below set the python path to the cloned project directory:

```
## Powershell: 
  $ $Env:PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"

## Shell:
  $ export PYTHONPATH="C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"

## Windows:
  $ setx PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"
```

## Usage
This project is for the demonstration and application of python and selenium program to interface with a webpage.
See the Pipfile for cumulative list of dependencies primarily needed for the scripts to run.
