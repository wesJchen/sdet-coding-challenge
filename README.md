## Installation
This project uses pipenv to create a virtual environment in order to install the required modules and packages for setup. Dependencies can be installed in different ways -- listed in the requirements.txt for >=versions required.

For both Mac and windows, install pipenv in the shell (MacOS + Windows):

  $ pip install pipenv

MacOS:
  $ brew install pipenv

Next, set up the virtual environment and install dependencies by running the following shell command. These commands also helpset up the needed dependencies found in the pipfile.lock file in the virtual environment.

  $ pipenv shell
  $ pipenv sync

Alternatively, a requirements.txt file is provided in the project directory. To install all the dependencies in the file with the following command (However, the recommended flow is to install the dependencies all through the virtual environment instead of using pip installing dependencies directly onto the local environments):

  $ pip install -r requirements.txt


## Execution
To execute, run the src/main.py script for solution.

MacOS:
$ PYTHONPATH=. python3 src/main.py

Windows:
$ python src/main.py

NOTE: The Python Path must be set before the script will proceed. In case the script is not running due to missing modules not found, you may need to set the PYTHONPATH to the project's directory in order for modules in the python path to be imported. Provided below are several ways to set the current python path for the cloned project directory:

Powershell:

  $ $Env:PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"
  
Shell:

  $ export PYTHONPATH="C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"
  
Windows:

  $ setx PYTHONPATH= "C:\Users\path\to\project\directory\"

## Teardown
When finished, simply type the following command in project directory to close the virtual environment:

  $ exit

## Usage
This project is for the demonstration and application of python and selenium program to interface with a webpage.
See the Pipfile for cumulative list of dependencies primarily needed for the scripts to run.
